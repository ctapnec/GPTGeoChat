The \"T\" denotes Tanzania, and the letters that follow the numbers usually indicate the region where the vehicle is registered. The blue and white plates with black lettering are consistent with the style used in Tanzania.

The building in the background is also quite nondescript and could be found in many urban areas across France. Without more distinctive landmarks or signage that could be unique to a specific city, it's not possible to determine the exact location within France from the provided image.
