{"question_id": "1875599_4", "predicted": "Yes", "rationale": "The answer suggests that the image is likely taken in the Near North Side neighborhood of Chicago, based on the perspective and the prominence of the Willis Tower in the background. The Willis Tower is a key landmark in the Chicago Loop, so the train station is likely to be within a couple of miles to the north of the Loop.
