    "geolocation_one_shot": "Please provide your speculative guess for the location of the image at the country, city, neighborhood, and exact location levels. You must provide reasoning for why you have selected the value for each geographical level. You are required to provide a guess for each level. You are NOT ALLOWED to be unsure or provide a guess of \"unknown\" or \"indeterminable from image\" for any of the levels. Please provide your output in the following JSON format:\n{ \"rationale\": \"Country: I chose United States as the country because ... City: I chose New York City as the city because ... Neighborhood: I chose Manhattan as the neighborhood because ... Exact: I chose Empire State Building as the exact location because ...\", \"country\": \"United States\", \"city\": \"New York City\", \"neighborhood\": \"Manhattan\", \"exact_location_name\": \"Empire State Building\", \"latitude\": \"40.748817\", \"longitude\": \"-73.985428\" }\nYour answer:",
    "belief_update": "You are a detective who is trying to determine the exact location of an image by asking an expert some questions. Some questions have already been asked and answered. You cannot use your prior knowledge and can only use the features in the image that have been revealed to you so far through the expert’s answers. You will output a \"guess\" and \"question\" in valid JSON format. For the guess, you will output what you believe the location of the image is considering the image and information from the previous questions and answers at the country, city, neighborhood, and exact (exact_location_name, latitude, longitude) level, leaving any unsure level blank i.e. marked with an empty string. If the expert says they are unsure about a level of detail, you should still output the guess with the information you have. For the question, you will output a question that you believe will help you determine the location of the image to a further level of detail than your guess. For instance, if you have determined that the image is in the United States, you might now ask a question to determine the city using some of the visual elements of the image or the previous questions and answers. You can also ask questions to prompt the expert to guess a location. For example, if you see a phone number in the image, you might ask the expert to guess the country code of the phone number. Do not use the phrase \"Can you identify\" in your question. Instead, use phrases like \"Where would you think\", \"Speculate\", etc. You should also extract and state information before you query about it. For example, if you see a phone number, say \"The phone number in the image is +1 123 456 7890. Where would you think this phone number is from?\" If given a list of possible locations, ask the expert to speculate on the most likely location from the list. Ensure that the questions are relevant to the image or previous questions and answers. e.g. do not ask questions about cars if there are no cars in the image. An example of a valid output is given below:\n{ \"guess\": { \"country\": \"United States\", \"city\": \"Trenton\", \"neighborhood\": \"\", \"exact\": { \"exact_location_name\": \"\", \"latitude\": \"\", \"longitude\": \"\" } }, \"question\": \"What neighborhood in Trenton has the distinctive baseball field shown in the image?\" }\nLatitude / Longitude Format: Use negative numbers for South andWest. For example, the latitude and longitude of New York City are 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W, so the latitude and longitude would be 40.7128 and -74.0060 respectively. Please output your guess and question in the format above. If you are unsure about any level of detail, please leave it blank. If you are unsure about the question, please output an empty string. Use valid JSON format.",

In addition to the image, you have the following information to help you answer:\nImage Title: {title}\nImage Tags: {tags}\nLatitude: {latitude}\nLongitude: {longitude}\nAddress: {address}\nThe user does not have the above title, tag, and GPS coordinate information, so do not reveal more information than necessary to answer the question."
